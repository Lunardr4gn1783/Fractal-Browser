# Fractal-Browser
A fully custom, community driven browser.


### **1. Core Features**  
- **Search Engine Algorithm**  
  - **Fractal-based Search Algorithms**  
    - Implement recursive, self-similar structures to organize search results.  
    - Results should adapt based on similarity rather than just keyword matching.  
  - **Deep Search**  
    - Implement a “deep search” that scans the web for matching text, not just top-level links.  
    - This feature should be optimized for efficiency and privacy.  
  - **AI-driven Query Expansion & Ranking Optimization**  
    - Use locally processed AI to expand queries and adjust rankings based on user behavior.  
    - **NPU/TPU/GPU** integration via DirectML for AI-powered ranking and expansion, ensuring hardware acceleration.  
    - AI models should evolve based on user interactions, providing more relevant results over time.  
  - **Privacy-focused Search**  
    - Local AI processing for all search-related tasks (no cloud-based processing).  
    - User search data and behavior must never leave the device.  
    - Use zero-knowledge proof algorithms to ensure privacy during query expansion and ranking.  

- **Privacy & Security**  
  - **Zero-Knowledge Search Mode**  
    - Encrypt search queries end-to-end, ensuring no data can be accessed by Fractal or external servers.  
  - **Local Storage & Processing**  
    - Store search history, preferences, and AI processing results locally.  
    - Keep search data completely private and not shared with any servers.  
  - **Decentralized Crawling**  
    - Allow Fractal users to contribute to search indexing by crawling content locally.  
    - Implement a system that allows community-driven crawling with decentralized storage for scalability.  
  - **Anti-fingerprinting & Anti-tracking**  
    - Implement methods to reduce fingerprinting, such as blocking tracking scripts, and offering privacy-enhancing features like VPN integration.  

- **Plugin Support**  
  - **Custom Search Behaviors**  
    - Allow users to create and install plugins that modify search behavior (e.g., custom ranking algorithms, filters).  
  - **Search Result Filtering**  
    - Enable users to filter results based on specific criteria like source credibility, type of content (e.g., academic, news, entertainment), or user preferences.  
  - **Third-party Integration**  
    - Allow integration with tools like citation generators, summarizers, or academic databases.

### **2. Search Visualization**  
- **Visualization Structure**  
  - **Fractal-like Result Display**  
    - Display search results in a **recursive, self-similar** structure, showing deeper, related results in a nested fashion.  
    - Visualize search results dynamically as new data is retrieved or as the search evolves.  
  - **Local and Global Versions**  
    - Local version: Allows users to browse and track their own searches privately.  
    - Global version: Displays connections between different data points across the internet, showing how search topics are interconnected.  
    - Option for users to contribute their local data to the global version, expanding the knowledge base.  

- **Node History & Accountability**  
  - **Tagging System**  
    - Allow users to tag search results (e.g., Fact, Fiction, Satire) and vote on their relevance or credibility.  
    - Tags must be visible in the search visualization and play a role in filtering and ranking results.  
  - **Moderator Rejection History**  
    - Display a log of when and why certain sources were rejected or reclassified, with reasons from moderators.  
    - Show when a source’s tag or safety status has changed.  
  - **Accountability System**  
    - Users can vote on the credibility or relevance of data, with moderators having the final say.  
    - Rejected tags must have an **explanation** visible to the community.  
    - Allow users to challenge moderator decisions, which will be reviewed by other moderators for accuracy.  

- **VirusTotal Integration**  
  - **Safety Rating for Websites**  
    - Show whether a website has been flagged as malicious, based on **VirusTotal** data.  
    - Websites flagged as dangerous will be highlighted in the search results with a risk warning.  
  - **Warning System**  
    - Display a **color-coded warning system** for each site (e.g., red for high risk, yellow for suspicious, green for safe).  
  - **Challenge & Appeal System**  
    - Allow users to challenge VirusTotal ratings if they believe a site was flagged incorrectly, with moderator verification.  
    - If a site has been reclassified or flagged as safe, show this change in the results.

### **3. Notification & User Interaction**  
- **Notification System**  
  - **Customizable Preferences**  
    - Let users choose to receive notifications for safety changes, fact-checking, or moderator actions.  
    - Notifications must be configurable with fine-grained options (e.g., immediate alerts, digest summaries, only for specific topics).  
  - **Granular Notification Controls**  
    - Let users control notification frequency and type (e.g., email, push notifications, in-browser).  
    - Allow users to toggle between **simple and advanced notification modes** for easier customization.  
  - **Personalized Notifications**  
    - Notifications should be based on user **search history**, preferences, and interactions.  
    - Provide a way for users to track websites or topics even without visiting them.  

- **OOBE (Out-Of-Box Experience)**  
  - **Step-by-Step Setup**  
    - Provide an **interactive setup mode** to guide users through initial configuration of Fractal, explaining key features.  
    - Allow users to **preview** settings for each feature during setup before committing.  
  - **Streamlined Setup**  
    - Provide a **streamlined setup mode** for users who prefer to configure everything upfront, without step-by-step guidance.  
  - **Progress Tracker**  
    - Show a **progress bar** or **step tracker** during OOBE to guide users through the setup process.  
    - Ensure users can easily revisit the OOBE at any time to adjust their settings.

### **4. Browser & UI Enhancements**  
- **Non-Chromium Browser Engine**  
  - Built on a **Firefox (Gecko)** core to ensure privacy, performance, and compatibility.  
  - **NPU/TPU/GPU Integration** via DirectML to optimize performance, particularly for AI-based search functions.  
  - **Multi-View Browsing** for comparing multiple search results side-by-side.  
  - **Dynamic Page Loading** prioritizes relevant content using Fractal’s recursive ranking system.  
  - **Offline Mode** that stores search results and web pages for offline access.  

- **Multi-View & Dynamic Loading**  
  - Allow multiple search results to be viewed in parallel, with dynamic content loading based on relevance.  
  - Enhance search and browsing speed by loading only the most pertinent parts of a page first.  

- **AI-Driven Research Tools**  
  - **Summarization Tools** for automatic content summaries on webpages.  
  - **Citation Generation** for academic and research-related content.  
  - **Adaptive Learning** based on past searches, generating reading lists and recommending relevant articles.

### **5. Decentralization & Blockchain Features**  
- **Lightweight Blockchain Integration**  
  - Use a **lightweight blockchain** for search verification and consensus without storing full indexes on-chain.  
  - Implement **community-hosted servers** for decentralized indexing, reducing reliance on centralized servers.  
  - Allow users to **contribute data** from their local searches to improve the global index.  
  - Ensure blockchain features remain **optional** for users who wish to contribute to the decentralized network.
